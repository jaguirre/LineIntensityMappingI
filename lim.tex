\begin{abstract}

We explore the possibility of studying the redshifted [CII] fine structure transition through cosmic time using the three-dimensional (3D) power spectra obtained with an imaging spectrometer. The intensity mapping approach measures the spatio-spectral fluctuations due to line emission from all galaxies, including those below the individual detection threshold. This technique not only provides 3D measurements of galaxy clustering, but contains astrophysical information---namely, the average intensity of total [CII] emission---which can be extracted from the linear portion of the power spectrum, with redshift information naturally encoded. We further compare the intensity mapping approach to galaxy surveys comprised of individually detected galaxies, and find that intensity mapping provides an unbiased estimate of the mean [CII] intensity. Depending on the noise level of a given experiment, intensity mapping may provide the only means of measuring this aggregate quantity. Also, depending on the shape of the luminosity function, intensity mapping can be a more efficient means of measuring the power spectrum. 

%Three dimensional (3D) measurements of galaxy clustering provide rich information about the process of galaxy formation and evolution, linking the theoretical structure of dark matter halos to the masses, types, luminosities, star formation rates, and numbers of galaxies inhabiting them at any epoch
%At redshifts $z>1$, however, the cosmic star formation rate becomes dominated by extremely dusty systems, and the appropriateness of using optically selected galaxies to study the clustering properties of these dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) is suspect.  Far-infrared lines are excellent unextincted tracers of the physics of the ISM and of star formation, but it is technically daunting to produce redshift surveys using these lines which will attain the necessary density to make precision measurements of the 3D clustering function.  In this paper, we explore 
%a new technique to measure galaxy clustering without individual detections of galaxies.  We develop robust predictions of line specific intensity for a suite of astrophysically interesting lines and make predictions about the detectability of the clustering signal via the 3D power spectrum of a data cube, where the galaxies need not be either spatially or spectrally resolved.  We show that line intensity mapping is an efficient method for imaging spectrometers like SPICA/SAFARI to obtain galaxy clustering measurements down to $k<0.1~h$Mpc$^{-1}$ and out as far as $z\sim3$.  

%intensity mapping is the only way to get an unbiased estimate of the total intensity, and in certain situations (ie, steep luminosity function) may be the best way of measuring the power spectrum.

% - Section 2, in which we discuss the model used for predicting the line power spectra, remains relatively unscathed. Need to keep discussion of lines general, and refrain from using [CII] as a specific example here. Also, will add an intro to the cross power spectrum and the theoretical explanation of the problem of interloper lines at the end of this section.
% 
% - Section 3, the "observational strategy section". Figure 2 will be moved to later in the section. Figures 4, 5, 8 -- the mode counting and SNR vs k plots -- will moved to the beginning. Figure 4 will be changed so that the left-hand point is (0,0) and the k_par and k_perp axes are equal in length. That way, we can identify "k-parallel" or "k-perpindicular" dominated modes as above and below a line drawn at 45 degrees from the origin. We can also plot the region affected by foreground contamination in the k_par-k_perp plane. Figures 6 will be redone to show that with 450 hours, one can measure the [SiII] power spectrum from individually detected sources, but with 45 hours, it is no longer possible to do so, while there is still high S/N on the intensity mapping measurement. We will include a new table that shows the Figure of Merit for the other lines, answering the question "At what z and with which lines is intensity mapping more efficient?"
% 
% - Need to mention that selecting a line is effectively selecting a galaxy type (e.g. high ionization lines for AGN) and so measuring different clustering with the different lines has astrophysical implications. (Are there any references to support why this might be expected to happen, beyond the old "red vs blue" galaxies observation? Thinking off the top of my head, I can imagine it might be possible to detect a different clustering signal for galaxies that are primarily found in merging systems. Not sure how big of an affect this would be in the power spectrum...)
% 
% -Figure 10 needs to make a new point. That is, we must show that the choice of Bethermin model here is robust enough to make valid predictions, based on what is already measured from the cosmic star formation history (Hopkins+Beacom). Also need to show that for lines that have a deficit with respect to LIR and and have a steep LF at the bright end, intensity mapping is useful. (But we have to be careful because [SiII] does not have this deficit with LIR and we have shown intensity mapping to be useful for this line.)

\section{Introduction}

Various observational techniques in astronomy, including, but not limited to, photometric and spectroscopic stacking analysis, \emph{P(D)} fluctuation analysis, and recently, cosmological spectral deconvolution (cf. \citet{dole2006, glenn10,deputter14} for examples of each), have been developed to provide a means to study the nature of galaxies that are otherwise too faint to be detected individually at high significance. These methods rely heavily on interpreting the statistical and aggregate properties of the extragalactic sources, and yet the insight they have provided into the nature of galaxies and their evolution with cosmic time has been invaluable. 

\emph{Line intensity mapping}, or 3-D tomographic mapping, is another technique that allows astronomers to probe extragalactic light from all sources, including the faintest galaxies and even diffuse intergalactic emission. An intensity mapping survey of a spectral line at different frequencies \emph{produces a fully three dimensional data cube containing ``tomographic scans" of the Universe along the spectral (i.e., redshift) direction.} The spatial fluctuations in line emission, contained in the data cube, are then decomposed into the power spectrum. Atomic \citep{gongcii,visbal11} and molecular \citep{lidz11,gong11co} transitions -- such as the 21-cm spin flip transition from H$^{\mathrm{o}}$, CO (2-1), and [CII] 158$\mu$m -- have been investigated as candidates for intensity mapping experiments during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Of these, the neutral hydrogen case is undoubtedly the most developed in terms of its standing in the literature (cf. \citet{morales10rev} for a review) and in the experimental arena (e.g., PAPER \citep{parsons14}, MWA \citep{tingay13}) because intensity mapping is the only means of studying the intergalactic HI light. [CII] later emerged as an EoR intensity mapping candidate since it both offers a way to probe the faint end of the luminosity function, and provides an opportunity for cross correlation with the HI datasets \citep{gongcii}.

Experiments targeting lower redshifts can offer a proof of principle of the approach, and neutral hydrogen is also the most mature in this respect. At $z\sim0.8$, \citet{chang10} measured the cross correlation between the 21-cm emission and a galaxy catalog and \citet{switzer13} put limits on the 21cm auto-power. \citet{Pullen13} explored the feasibility of measuring the clustering in Lyman alpha emission from the EoR and down to $z\sim2$.

Here we examine the application of the intensity mapping technique to moderate redshifts, targeting the fine structure line emission from ionized carbon during $0.5 < z < 1.5$.  The majority of extragalactic [CII] arises from the neutral and ionized interstellar medium (ISM) of star-forming galaxies, with only a negligible contribution from the IGM \citep{gongcii}. This far-infrared (FIR) line is a well-suited probe of the galaxy population during the relevant time frame, as the mean dust attenuation in galaxies peaks at $z \sim 1.5$, when roughly 80\% of the cosmic star formation rate density is obscured and captured only in the infrared emission of re-processed starlight by dust grains \citep{burgarella13}. Moreover, [CII] is typically the brightest FIR line emitted from the ISM of galaxies, with luminosities up to 0.1\% of the IR luminosity, and is an important sign-post of star formation and related dynamics in galaxies \citep{gracia-carpio11, sargsyan12, diaz-santos13}

A power spectrum analysis of 3-D [CII] tomography expands upon recent works that utilize the fluctuations in emission rather than individual object detections to study the properties of dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). (See \citet{casey14} et al for a review of DSFGs at the redshifts of interest to this study.) These studies, using \emph{P(D)} \citep{glenn10, bethermin11} or a 2-D power spectrum \citep{viero13} analysis, have already shed light on some aspects (such as the number counts or spatial clustering) of the bulk of these systems from $z = 1-3$, but they are limited by source confusion or uncertainties associated with the lack of redshift information, respectively. Redshift ambiguities can be removed to some extent with galaxy-by-galaxy surveys with the interferometers ALMA or NOEMA, or with an instrument like X-Spec, a proposed multi-object spectrometer for CCAT. However, the interferometer surveys will be expensive, and the CCAT surveys, though faster, will not reach the faintest galaxies in the luminosity function. Power spectrum treatment of the 3-D maps naturally combines the redshift precision of spectral measurements, while including all sources in the luminosity function, and can be carried out with an instrument that does not require exquisite point-source sensitivity. 

This sensitivity of the power spectrum to galaxies below the individual detection threshold, indeed to the mean aggregate intensity in the line from all sources, is a unique line of inquiry for the galaxy populations. Namely, by extracting the mean intensity of [CII], or any emission line of interest, from the power spectrum at a number of observed frequencies, intensity mapping provides a means of quantifying the aggregate luminosity from all [CII]-emitting sources at a given redshift. An example of using the power spectrum to determine luminosity density can be found in \citet{planckXXX}, although the results discussed there were derived from the 2-D angular power spectrum of IR continuum fluctuations, which relies on fits which include uncertainties in the dust spectral energy distributions, for instance. With inherent redshift information from the spectral line, such an observation of the 3-D power spectrum would ascertain the cosmic evolution of the Universe's total output in [CII] with a level of precision not available by other means. 

The organization of this paper is as follows. We have calculated the mean intensity for a suite of fine structure IR emission lines, including the [CII] line, based on the IR luminosity function and empirical line-to-IR luminosity correlations, and present these results in the context of a power spectrum model in Section 2. In Section 3, we envision a suitable platform---namely, a balloon-borne experiment operating at frequencies between 240$\mu$m to 420$\mu$m---for conducting the [CII] intensity mapping experiment and discuss the feasibility of detecting the [CII] power spectra in terms of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio. From the power spectra, we provide estimates for accuracy on measuring the mean [CII] intensity as a function of redshift. To better assess the value of intensity mapping studies in the case of [CII] at moderate redshifts, and of intensity mapping experiments in general, we compare in Section 4 the performance of the intensity mapping approach against spectroscopic galaxy surveys that rely on individual detections of sources to measure the power spectrum. In particular, we examine the effects of variations in luminosity function shape, aperture diameter (and, consequently, pixel size), and experimental noise on the ability of each observational method to measure the power spectrum and provide a complete view of the galaxy population. 

\section{Predictions for FIR Line Power Spectra}

\subsection{Relationship Between Galaxy Populations and Fluctuation Power}

The complete auto power spectrum of a given FIR line as a function of wavenumber $k$, $P_{i,i}(k,z)$, can be separated into power from the clustering of galaxies, $P_{i,i}^{clust}(k,z)$ and a Poisson term describing their discrete nature, $P_{i,i}^{shot}(z)$. We compute the full nonlinear matter power spectrum, $P_{\delta,\delta}(k, z)$, using the publicly available code HALOFIT+ (http://camb.info), which has been the standard tool for predicting matter power spectra upon its success in fitting state-of-the-art dark matter simulations over a decade ago \citep{halofit}.  The clustering component of the line power spectrum is then written as

\begin{equation}
 P_{i,i}^{clust}(k, z) = \bar{S}_{i}^2(z) \bar{b_i}^2(z) P_{\delta\delta}(k, z).
 \label{eq:pclust}
 \end{equation}

Here we have implicitly assumed that the fluctuations in line emission trace the matter power spectrum with some average bias, $\bar{b_i}(z)$, chosen in line with observations of galaxies from the redshift range of interest to this study \citep{Cooray10, Jullo12}. By assuming a bias, it should be noted that our model does not take into account a possibly variation of the source bias with the host halo mass (and thus luminosity), but XXX

The mean line intensity, $\bar{S}_{i}(z)$, in units of Jy sr$^{-1}$, can be calculated as

\begin{equation}
\bar{S}_{i}(z) = \int{\mathrm{d}n_{i} \frac{L_{i}}{4\pi D_L^2}} y_i D_A^2 ,
\end{equation}

where the integration is taken with respect to $n_{i}$, the number of galactic line emitters per cosmological comoving volume element. (The factor $y_i$ is the derivative of the comoving radial distance with respect to the observed frequency, i.e. $y = d\chi/d\nu = \lambda_{i,rest} (1+z)^2/H(z)$, and $D_A$ is the comoving angular distance.)

Finally, the shot noise component of the total line power spectrum---with the same units as the clustering term, namely, Jy$^2$ sr$^{-2}$ (Mpc h$^{-1})^{3}$---takes the form 

\begin{equation}
P_{i,i}^{shot}(z) = \int{\mathrm{d}n_{i} \left( \frac{L_{i}}{4\pi D_L^2} \right)^2 \left( y_i D_A^2 \right)^2}.
 \label{eq:pshot}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Calculating IR line volume emissivity}

The number density of line emitters and the line luminosity that appear in equations (2) and (3) can be derived by a variety of methods. In earlier papers on intensity mapping of molecular and fine-structure emission lines at high redshift (z $\gtrsim$ 6), one approach involved using the dark matter halo mass function in lieu of the line emitter density (and invoking a one-to-one correlation between halos and galaxies, which is reasonable at high redshifts). The line luminosity, in turn, could be scaled according to the star formation rate, which was related to halo mass via a proportionality constant comprised of factors describing the fraction of baryons available for star formation, as well as the dynamical timescale for star formation and a duty cycle for emission. While this approach is perhaps justified for the very early Universe (given the lack of information about the galaxy luminosity function at high redshift), the situation at later times is better understood; we make use of empirical constraints on the $z\sim1$ epoch from FIR/submm number counts and observations of FIR line emission in galaxies. 

We first employ the empirically-constrained, backwards-evolution model of the IR luminosity function $\Phi(L_{IR}, z)$ from \citet{bethermin11} (hereafter B11) to predict the number of galaxies with luminosity $L_{IR}$ at a given redshift in some comoving volume of the Universe per logarithmic luminosity interval, i.e., $\frac{\mathrm{d}N(L_{IR},z)}{\mathrm{d}V\mathrm{dlog_{10}}L_{IR}}$ or $\frac{\mathrm{d}n_{IR}}{\mathrm{dlog_{10}}L_{IR}}$.

To convert the infrared luminosity to a line luminosity, we apply the relation for $L_{i}$ as a function of $L_{IR}$ provided by \citet{spinoglio12}. The fit in their paper was based on the collection of ISO-LWS observations of local galaxies in \citet{brauher08}. For example, we reproduce below the relation for [CII]
\begin{equation}
L_{\mathrm{[CII]158}}(L_{\mathrm{IR}}) = (0.89 \pm 0.03) \mathrm{log_{10}}L_{\mathrm{IR}} - (2.44 \pm 0.07),
\end{equation}

indicating that [CII] is suppressed for higher luminosity systems. In general, the other FIR lines are more uniform in their IR luminosity ratio. 

Thus, it becomes possible to write the cosmic mean intensity and shot noise of the line, in units of Jy sr$^{-1}$,  as a function of redshift based on the B11 luminosity function and \citet{spinoglio12} $L_{i}-L_{\mathrm{IR}}$ relation as

\begin{equation} \label{eq:intensity}
\bar{S}_{\mathrm{i}}(z) = \int_{L_{IR,min}}^{L_{IR,max}} \mathrm{dlog}L_{IR}  \Phi(L_{IR}, z) \frac{f_{i} L_{IR} }{4 \pi D_{L}^2} y D_A^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation} \label{eq:pshotlum}
P_{i,i}^{shot}(z) = \int_{L_{IR,min}}^{L_{IR,max}} \mathrm{dlog}L_{IR}  \Phi(L_{IR}, z) \left(\frac{f_{i} L_{IR}}{4 \pi D_{L}^2} y D_A^2\right)^2
\end{equation}

where $f_{i}$, i.e. $\frac{L_{i}(L_{IR})}{L_{IR}}$, is the fraction of IR luminosity emitted in line $i$, as computed from equation (3). In other words, we have written $\bar{S}_{i}$ and $P_{i,i}^{shot}(z)$ as the first and the second moments of the luminosity function.

\caption{Intensity of fine structure line emission as a function of observed wavelength for the empirical model based on the B11 luminosity function.}
\label{fig:interlopers}
\end{figure}

The resulting mean intensities for a variety of FIR lines are plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:interlopers} as a function of redshift and observed wavelength. $\bar{S}_{i}$ vs $\lambda_{obs}$ can be interpreted as identifying the dominant source of fluctuations, according to our model, for a given frequency. As a specific example, if the target line of an observation is [OI]63$\mu$m at $z = 1$, it is necessary to distinguish between the target line and interlopers like [OIII]88$\mu$m from $z=0.4$ and [OIII]52$\mu$m from $z=1.4$, which contribute power at the observed frequency. Visbal and Loeb (2010) showed how the cross spectra can be used to differentiate between a target line and a contaminating line (or ``bad line", in their words), since emitters at different redshifts will be spatially uncorrelated. For the observed wavelengths of [CII], however, it is apparent from Figure 2 that, with the exception of contributions from [OIII]88$\mu$m and CO(8-7) near [CII] at $z \sim 0.01$ and $z>2$, respectively, the [CII] line is relatively unaffected by interloper lines---a result of its luminosity and spectral isolation.

\subsection{[CII] Luminosity Functions and Expected Power Spectra}

As laid out in Equation~\ref{eq:pclust}, $P_{\textrm{[CII],[CII]}}^{clust}$ is sensitive to intensity fluctuations from the full range of normal ($L_{IR} < 10^{11}$ L$_{\odot}$) to ULIRG-class ($L_{IR} > 10^{12}$ L$_{\odot}$) systems because its amplitude is proportional to the mean line intensity, squared. Figure~\ref{fig:frac_cii_b11_lirmin} shows the integrated luminosity functions for [CII] in our model, which gives a sense of the depth that a galaxy survey must reach in order to completely probe the full integrated [CII] emission, i.e. all of $\bar{S}_i$. In this section, we examine the role of the various luminosity ranges on the amplitude of the observed [CII] power.  

Power spectra at four representative redshifts ($z = 0.63, 0.88, 1.16$, and $1.48$) comprised of the sources above a few different survey depths, or  $L_{IR, min}$, are represented by Figure~\ref{fig:pcii_lirmin}. (Note that we use  $\Delta_{\textrm{[CII],[CII]}}^2 = k^3 P_{\textrm{[CII], [CII]}}(k)/(2\pi^2)$ when plotting the power spectrum. In this notation, the factor $k^3$ cancels out the volumetric units of $P_{\delta,\delta}(k,z)$ and the integral of $\Delta_{\textrm{[CII],[CII]}}^2$ over logarithmic k bins is equal to the variance in real space.) At these redshifts, respectively, the average linear bias has been assumed to be $\bar{b} = 2.0, 2.3, 2.6$, and $2.9$. In this Figure, we see the clustering amplitude decrease as the IR detection threshold is raised from 10$^{8}$ L$_{\odot}$ to 10$^{12}$ L$_{\odot}$.  (Note that the reduction in the clustering amplitude is precisely the square of the factor of reduction in $\bar{S}_{\textrm{[CII]}}$ plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:frac_cii_b11_lirmin}.) The level of decrease in clustering power as a result of raising $L_{IR,min}$ is most dramatic at the lower end of the redshift range of interest, when the luminosity function is represented mostly by normal galaxies and LIRGs. As ULIRGs rise to dominate the IR luminosity function at $z\sim1.5$, we see that the amplitude of the clustering component of $P_{\textrm{[CII],[CII]}}(k,z)$ becomes relatively robust until $L_{IR,min} \sim 10^{12}$ L$_{\odot}$. In fact, we infer from from Figure~\ref{fig:frac_cii_b11_lirmin} that, at $z = 1.48$, individually resolving galaxies at a depth of $6\times10^{11}$ will recover half of the [CII] light. (For redshifts $z=0.63, 1.16$ and $3.0$, the corresponding depths to observe half of the [CII] light are $\sim 10^{11}$, $2\times10^{11}$, and $10^{12}$ L$_{\odot}$, respectively.

%\begin{equation}
%P_{i,j}(k,z)& = \bar{S}_i(z) \bar{S}_j(z) \bar{b}_i(z) \bar{b}_j(z) P_{nl}(k,z) + P_{shot}^{i,j}(k) %\\
%\end{equation}

%In the case of far-IR lines, where there is no observational evidence of emitting populations with distinct clustering properties, it is justified to take $\bar{b}_i(z) = \bar{b}_j(z)$. Note that this equality may not hold between the far-IR lines and certain near- and mid-IR lines, which are primarily produced in AGN, and which may have different clustering characteristics.

%Incorporating the IR luminosity function in the approach to estimating the [CII] density facilitates the separation of [CII]-emitting galaxies by luminosity class, i.e., ULIRG, LIRG, or normal galaxy, which is useful since there is not a one-to-one mapping of [CII] luminosity to infrared luminosity for individual galaxies. To understand, then, the relation between [CII] emission from a diverse ensemble of galaxies present in the power spectrum to the star formation rate at a given redshift, it is imperative to sort out the mix of galaxy types and corresponding luminosities that contribute to the total emission. We use the recent compilation of Gracia-Carpio et al. (2011) for the measured relation of $L_{[CII]}$ to $L_{FIR}$ in a range of systems. 

%For most normal galaxies (here taken to mean $L_{FIR} < 10^{11} L_{\odot}$) at any redshift, the $L_{[CII]}/L_{FIR}$ ratio is approximately equal to $3 \times 10^{-3}$ (with a $1-\sigma$ scatter of only $\sim$ 0.3 dex). Since $L_{FIR}$ is well known to tightly correlate with SFR (Kennicutt??), for these systems the $L_{[CII]}$ traces the SFR with a known proportionality constant. 

%In the local universe, dense, high ionization environments are typical of the central star-forming regions of ULIRGs ($L > 10^{12} L_{\odot}$) or LIRGS ($L>10^{11} L_{\odot}$). These environments exhibit underluminous [CII] emission because [CII] is strongly sensitive to the intensity of the UV field and saturates at high UV fluxes. For nearby sources with $L>10^{12} L_{\odot}$, $L_{[CII]}/L_{FIR}$ drops by a factor of $\sim$ 5-10, and $L_{[CII]}$ no longer scales with SFR, but such sources are rare at $z<0.01$ and account for only a small fraction of the total SFR density. Hence, at these redshifts, the bulk of the [CII] emission is from "normal"-type galaxies that obey the relatively tight correlation between $L_{[CII]}-L_{FIR}$. 

%By contrast, at $z \sim 1$, the fraction of SFRD contributed by high luminosity sources substantially increases. At $z = 1-2$, however, the Stacey et al (2010) results show that the threshold for a significant deficiency in $L_{[CII]}$ rises to $L \sim 5 \times 10^{12} L_{\odot}$ (Figure ??), so that the majority of the emission again still adheres to a relatively tight correlation, and the fraction contributed by sources with weak [CII] appears to remain negligible at all redshifts. 

%We can characterize the redshift evolution of $\kappa$ from the IR luminosity function. This behavior is plotted in Figure XXX. 


%\begin{equation}
%\bar{L}_{\mathrm{[CII]}} = \int_{L_{IR}^{min}}^{L_{IR}^{max}} \! \mathrm{d}(\mathrm{log_{10}} \, L_{IR}) L_{IR} \Phi(L_{IR}, z) f_{[CII]}(L_{IR}).
%\end{equation}

%The fraction $f_{[CII]}(L_{IR})$ is obtained from the fit for [CII] luminosity---based on local ISO-LWS observations (Brauher et al 2008)---as a function of IR luminosity provided by Spinoglio et al (2011, their equation 33, reproduced below):

%\begin{equation}
%\begin{split}
%f_{[CII]}(L_{IR})& =\frac{L_{[CII]}}{L_{IR}}\\
%                           & =\frac{(0.89 \pm 0.03) \mathrm{log_{10}}L_{IR} - (2.44 \pm 0.07)}{L_{IR}}.
%\end{split}
%\end{equation}

%Finally, in terms of the IR luminosity function, the shot noise becomes

%P_{shot}^{\mathrm{[CII],[CII]}}(k) =  \int_{L_{IR}^{min}}^{L_{IR}^{max}} \! \mathrm{d}(\mathrm{log_{10}}L_{IR}) \, \Phi(L_{IR}, z)\\
%\times  f_{[CII]}(L_{IR}) \left( \frac{L_{\mathrm{[CII]}}}{4\pi D_L^2} \right)^2 \left( \frac{\mathrm{d}\chi}{\mathrm{d}\nu} D_A^2 \right)^2
%\end{multline}

%It should be noted that the mean [CII] luminosity $\bar{L}^{[CII]}$ does, in reality, include a contribution from diffuse gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM), yet Gong et al (2012) estimated that the specific intensity coming from the IGM ranges from $\sim 10^{-3}$ Jy sr$^{-1}$ to $\sim$ 1 Jy sr$^{-1}$ at $z = 1$---a negligible amount compared to the emission from the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. 

\section{The [CII] Power Spectrum}

\subsection{Observational Sensitivity to the Power Spectrum}

We present in this section predictions for the [CII] power spectrum with error bar estimates for a feasible experimental platform, namely, a balloon-borne experiment that allows for uninterrupted spectral coverage in the wavelength range 240 to 420 $\mu$m pertinent to this study. Fiducial experimental parameters are summarized in Table ~\ref{tab:ExpParams}. The telescope mirror aperture, $D_{ap}$, survey area, $A_{survey}$, and total observing time, $t_{obs}^{survey}$, are taken as 2.5 m, 1 deg$^2$, and 200 hours, respectively, though we explore the effect of varying $D_{ap}$ and $A_{survey}$ on SNR (cf. Figure~\ref{fig:snr_nmode_k}).

Error bar estimates and the total SNR for the power spectrum are calculated by assuming a spectrally flat noise power spectrum, so that the noise power in each pixel, $P_{N}$, is written as

\begin{equation}
P_N = \sigma_N^2 \frac{V_{pix}}{t_{pix}},
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_N^2$ is the instrument sensitivity (noise equivalent intensity, or NEI, in units of Jy sr$^{-1}$ s$^{1/2}$, $V_{pix}$ is the volume of a pixel, and $t_{obs}^{pix}$ is the time spent observing on a single pixel. The variance of a measured $k$, $\sigma^2(k)$, is then written as

\begin{equation}
\sigma^2(k) = \frac{\left({P_{\textrm{[CII],[CII]}}(k) + P_N(k)}\right)^{2}}{N_{modes}},
\end{equation}

where $N_{modes}$ is the number of wavemodes that are sampled for a given $k$ bin of some finite width $\Delta$log(k). (We have chosen $\Delta$log(k) = 0.3 for this analysis.)

The total SNR, in turn, is calculated from the expression 

\begin{equation}
SNR_{tot} = \sqrt{\sum_{bins} \left(\frac{P_{\textrm{[CII],[CII]}}(k)}{\sigma(k)}\right)^2}
\end{equation}

The expected [CII] power spectrum, with corresponding predictions for SNR, at the same redshifts from Figure~\ref{fig:pcii_lirmin} are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pcii_zall}. In calculating the power spectrum sensitivity for these power spectra, the two lowest line-of-sight modes and the lowest transverse mode are not included, since these modes will likely be compromised by the necessity of continuum foreground subtraction and beam-differencing in the fluctuation analysis. (The exact effect of continuum subtraction will need to be modeled via simulation.) We find that the total power spectrum, including power from both shot noise and clustering, is observable with $\textrm{SNR}>10$ in the redshift range from $z = 0.88-1.48$; the clustering power, in turn, can be detected with $\textrm{SNR}>5$ at all examined redshifts. 

In Figure~\ref{fig:snr_nmode_k} we examine the effect on SNR of changing the survey area and telescope aperture, where the SNR has been plotted as a function of $k$. To better demonstrate how the observational parameters drive the behavior of SNR($k$) illustrated in this Figure, we rewrite $P_N$ in terms of the parameters from Table 1, giving 

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
P_N& = \left(\sigma_N^2 A_{pix} \Delta r_{los}^{pix}\right) / \left({\frac{t_{survey}}{n_{beams}/N_{instr}^{spatial}}}\right) \\
& = \left(\sigma_N^2 A_{pix}\Delta r_{los}^{pix}\right) /  \left(\frac{t_{survey} N_{instr}^{spatial}}{A_{survey}/A_{pix}}\right)\\
& = \sigma_N^2 \frac{\Delta r_{los}^{pix} A_{survey}}{t_{survey} N_{instr}^{spatial}}
\end{split}
\label{eq:pnoise}
\end{equation}

In this form, it becomes apparent that---with fixed number of spatial pixels, spectral resolution, and total observing time---the only factor driving up the amplitude of noise power is the survey area; the effect of increasing aperture only allows access to higher wavenumbers, which can be useful for subtracting the shot noise from the total power in later steps of data analysis.

\subsection{Measuring $\bar{S}_{[CII]}(z)$}

As noted above, intensity mapping is naturally sensitive to the full range of galaxy luminosities through the mean intensity, which is imprinted in the linear (2-halo) clustering term. Shot noise must be accurately subtracted, and this should be straightforward given the high SNR in the shot-noise dominated k bins (Figure~\ref{fig:snr_nmode_k}). Next, per Equation~\ref{eq:pclust}, it is necessary to divide out $P_{\delta,\delta}(k,z)$ and  $\bar{b}_{\textrm{[CII]}}^2(z)$.The confidence with which are \emph{a priori} known quantities becomes lower as $k$ increases. For example, the 1-halo power spectrum for DSFGs appears to be dependent on the IR luminosity of the contributing sources \citep{viero13}, indicating the need to map sufficiently wide areas that access $k$ modes where the power is largely independent of the level of 1-halo power. 

Returning to Figure~\ref{fig:snr_nmode_k}, we see that, for the purpose of measuring $\bar{S}_{\textrm{[CII]}}$ with the fiducial survey of 1 deg$^2$, there are two $k$ bins ($k = 0.16$ and 0.27 h/Mpc) in which the 2-halo clustering accounts for at least 75\% of the total power. (Surveys with $A_{survey} = 5.3$ and 10 deg$^2$, also shown in Figure~\ref{fig:snr_nmode_k}, are wide enough to have three $k$ bins available in the linear regime, but the sensitivity on the additional mode with $t_{obs}^{survey}$= 200 hours is marginal.) Thus, in considering the case of $A_{survey} = 1.0$ deg$^2$, we find that it is possible to measure $\rho_{\textrm{[CII]}}(z)$ within $\sim10\%$ accuracy from $z = 0.63$ to $z=1.48$, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:scii_z}, where the fractional uncertainty on $\bar{S}_{\textrm{[CII]}}(k,z)$ has been calculated as half the fractional uncertainty on $P_{\textrm{[CII],[CII]}}(k,z)$. In Figure~\ref{fig:scii_z}, we also include, for comparison, an estimate for $\rho_{\textrm{[CII]}}(z)$ based on the analytic fit to SFRD($z$) provided by \citet{hb06} and a constant ratio of 0.003 between $L_{\textrm{[CII]}}$ and $L_{IR}$. (We use the correlation between SFRD and infrared luminosity described in \citet{kennicutt98}.) This simple-minded prescription likely overestimates the true [CII] luminosity at redshifts $z \gtrsim 1$, due to the observed [CII] deficiency in ULIRGs, which dominate the IR luminosity density at these redshifts.

\section{Observational Strategy: Comparing Intensity Mapping with Traditional Galaxy Surveys}

Now let us turn to a question regarding the motivation for intensity mapping in general, as well as in the specific case of [CII] at the redshifts relevant to this study. Having identified the galaxy redshift surveys as an alternative method to measure the 3D clustering power spectrum, it is natural to ask: In which regime does intensity mapping measure the power spectrum with higher SNR than the traditional galaxy surveys?

The expressions for SNR on a $k$ bin of interest for galaxy and intensity mapping surveys (denoted, respectively, by the subscripts ``GS" and ``IM") are

\begin{eqnarray}
\textrm{SNR}_{GS}  = \frac{\sqrt{N_{modes}} }{1 + 1/(b_i^2P_{\delta,\delta}\bar{n}_{gal} )} \\
\textrm{SNR}_{IM} =  \frac{\sqrt{N_{modes}}}{1 + P_N/\left(\bar{S}_{i}^2b_i^2P_{\delta,\delta}\right)}
\end{eqnarray}

To facilitate our comparisons in what follows, we employ toy models for the IR LF (Figure ~\ref{fig:schechterfuncs}) written in the Schechter formalism---parametrized by the usual $\alpha$, $L_*$, and $\phi_*$---and normalize the total luminosity density to the empirical model from Section 2 (cf. Appendix for details). We stress that these Schechter models are not intended to represent a real interpretation of the distribution of galaxies, but are merely helpful for illustrating the effect of the LF \emph{shape} on the relative usefulness of intensity mapping and traditional galaxy surveys.

\begin{figure}

\caption{Toy model IR luminosity functions with faint-end slope (from top to bottom) $\alpha=-1.0, -1.5, -2.0, -2.5, -3.0$. The B11 and Muprhy \& Bradford models are plotted as blue and red curves, respectively, for comparison.}
\label{fig:schechterfuncs}

\end{figure}

The line sensitivity, $S_{\gamma}$ (units of W m$^{-2}$ s$^{1/2}$), is the figure of merit for detecting an unresolved line in a point source, and we define individual detections at the $5\sigma$ level as having a flux above the instrumental noise in a pixel, i.e., above $5 \times S_{\gamma} t_{pix}^{-1/2}$. (For this analysis, we have assumed the galaxy surveys have reliable spectroscopic redshifts and thus neglect the problem of confusion noise.) %A convenient expression, which explicitly ties the minimum detectable luminosity to a broader framework of experimental variables, for the detection threshold can be written as
%\begin{equation}
%L_{i, min} = 5 \times f_{err}\rho_i V_{pix}, 
%\end{equation}
%Here, $f_{err}$ is the fractional error, 
%\begin{equation}
%f_{err} = \left(\frac{\sigma_N}{\sqrt{t_{pix}}}\right)/\bar{S}_i(z)
%\end{equation}
% and $\rho_{i}(z)$ is the comoving luminosity density of line $i$ at some $z$, or $L_*\phi_* \Gamma(2+\alpha, L/L_*)$ in the Schechter notation, so that
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{L_{i,min}}{4\pi D_L^2} \Leftrightarrow 5 \times S_{\gamma} t_{pix}^{-1/2}
%\end{equation}
 
%Recall that the units of $\frac{\sigma_{N}}{\sqrt{t_{pix}}}$ and $S_{i}$ are Jy sr$^{-1}$, which does not depend on aperture. One converts between $\sigma_N$ and $S_{\gamma}$ by dividing (or multiplying) by the frequency resolution d$\nu$ and beam solid angle d$\Omega$.
 
Since the intensity mapping technique contains information in the power spectrum from sources below a given $S_{\gamma}$, we expect that regimes in which the majority of galaxies are too faint to be resolved are better-suited for intensity mapping observations than observations via the traditional galaxy survey. %We identify, and will discuss each in turn, three regimes where this scenario is likely: when the faint-end slope of the luminosity function is steep; when the telescope aperture (i.e., pixel size) is large; and, when the instrumental noise is large. 

One such regime is when the bulk of the galaxy number density at a certain redshift is comprised of galaxies with sub-$L_*$ luminosities (i.e., for steep slope $\alpha$ in the LF). Indeed, this case is illustrated in the middle and righthand panels of Figure~\ref{fig:snr_vs_time_z1p5}, where, for LFs with $\alpha < -1.5$, the intensity mapping method (magenta curve) has higher SNR than the corresponding galaxy survey performed with the same instrument (dashed black curve), for all survey observing times. (Note the galaxy survey and intensity mapping survey map the same fiducial area in this example.) However, for the flattest faint-end slope ($\alpha = -1$, lefthand panel), both techniques have comparable SNR for most observing times. We point out that SNR$_{IM} >$ SNR$_{GS}$ for very short and very long observing times, which correspond to shot-noise dominated and cosmic variance-dominated regimes, respectively, for the galaxy surveys. Also, note that SNR$_{GS}$ and SNR$_{IM}$ have the opposite behavior with steepening $\alpha$. The intensity mapping technique is not degraded by a steepening of the luminosity function because it does not rely on individual detections. In our model, SNR$_{IM}$ is actually enhanced due to the unmitigated [CII] emission in normal galaxies (versus ULIRG-class galaxies that are deficient in [CII]).

Figure~\ref{fig:snr_vs_time_z1p5} also shows the effect of changing pixel area by a factor $\epsilon$---due to a change in the telescope's aperture diameter by $\epsilon^{-1/2}$---on the SNR. Because the area of the survey is fixed, the transformation on pixel area leads to a change in $S_{\gamma}$ by the same factor $\epsilon$, but will not alter $P_{N}$ (as seen previously in Eq.~\ref{eq:pnoise}) for the intensity mapping experiment; SNR$_{IM}$ of large-scale clustering modes is robust to changes in pixel area. Thus, the instruments with smaller pixels (triple-dot dashed curve, $\epsilon = 0.1$) achieve greater depths than their large pixel counterparts (dot-dashed curve, $\epsilon = 10.0$), and thus attain higher SNR by resolving more galaxies. Meanwhile, galaxy surveys with large pixels find themselves in the disabling condition of having many sources that are below the detection threshold in a single voxel. Whether or not the galaxy survey experiments with small pixel area outperform the intensity mapping experiment is, however, dependent on the faint-end slope of the luminosity function. 
 
 
 
%V_{pix}$ suggests that traditional galaxy surveys with large voxels, such that $L_*\phi_* \Gamma(2+\alpha, L/L_*) V_{pix} \gg 1$, will find themselves in the disabling condition of having many sources that are below the detection threshold in a single voxel. On the other hand, because the intensity mapping method does not aim to detect individual galaxies, it will still be able to measure clustering in the large voxel limit with high SNR.  We juxtapose in Figure \ref{fig:snr_vs_time_z1p5} the SNR for the fiducial intensity mapping experiment and galaxy surveys in both the large and small pixel limit in the context of our example for the [CII] power spectrum at $z = 1.48$. As seen in the previous section, a change in aperture does not affect the SNR$_{IM}$ for $k < 0.1$ h/Mpc, but, as expected, dramatically enhances or degrades the capability of galaxy surveys in measuring the power spectrum.  From Figure \ref{fig:snr_vs_time_z1p5} it is clear that the fiducial intensity mapping experiment outperforms galaxy surveys at $z=1.48$ for luminosity functions with faint-end slope $\alpha$ of the tested luminosity functions, and, that this disparity is enhanced in the large pixel limit. In the small pixel limit however, where we expect the galaxy surveys to be capable of measuring the power spectrum with high significance, we see that it becomes important to consider the shape of the luminosity function when drawing conclusions about whether to intensity map or perform a traditional galaxy survey. In fact, it seems that only for the flattest luminosity functions does the small pixel limit improve SNR$_{tot, GS}$ such that it becomes higher than SNR$_{tot,GS}$.

 
 %\begin{figure}
%\centering
%\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{lirmin_lsun_tsurvey_z1p5_1sqdeg_0p1vpix_vpix_10vpix}
%\caption{$L_{IR,min}$ as a function of the survey observing time, for the various $V_{pix}$, at $z = 1.5$. The value of our adopted $L_{*}$ is plotted for comparison.}
% \label{fig:lirmin_z1p5}
%\end{figure}

%Written in this way, the expression for the detection threshold $L_{i,min}$ already provides some insight as to the optimal regimes for intensity mapping and galaxy surveys. Firstly, for $L_{i,min} \ll L_*$, we expect the galaxy surveys to be an effective means of studying the galaxy population, since the number of detections will be high and the shot noise term will be low. Conversely, if $L_{i, min} \gg L_*$, then the galaxy survey will not be able to detect a significant fraction of galaxies that comprise the faint-end of the luminosity function, and intensity mapping becomes the ideal survey method, since it is sensitive to the total emission at a given redshift.

%Now, suppose the voxels are changed in size by some factor $\epsilon$ due to a change in aperture diameter by $\sqrt{\epsilon}$, but the survey area and survey observing time are left the same, leading to the following transformations on $t_{pix}$, the large scale clustering modes $N_{modes}^{clust}$, $P_{N}$, $f_{err}$, and, ultimately, $L_{i,min}$:

%\begin{eqnarray}
%t_{pix} \rightarrow t_{pix}^{\prime} &= \epsilon t_{pix} \\
%N_{modes}^{clust} \rightarrow N_{modes}^{clust \prime} &= N_{modes}^{clust} \\
%P_N \rightarrow P_N^{\prime} &= P_{N} \\
%f_{err} \rightarrow f_{err}^{\prime} &= \frac{f_{err}}{\sqrt{\epsilon}} \\
%L_{i,min} \rightarrow L_{i,min}^{\prime} &= \sqrt{\epsilon} L_{i,min}
%\end{eqnarray}

%We take a moment to point out that an increase in aperture diameter by $\sqrt{\epsilon}$ also results in an increase in the righthand side of Equation 15 by the same factor $\sqrt{\epsilon}$ that appears in Equation 20 after applying the analogous transformations for the line sensitivity:

%\begin{eqnarray}
%S_{\gamma} \rightarrow S_{\gamma}^{\prime} = \epsilon S_{\gamma}\\
%t_{pix} \rightarrow t_{pix}^{\prime} = \epsilon t_{pix} \\
%\end{eqnarray}

%Thus, the increase of $L_{i,min}$ with $V_{pix}$ suggests that traditional galaxy surveys with large voxels, such that $L_*\phi_* \Gamma(2+\alpha, L/L_*) V_{pix} \gg 1$, will find themselves in the disabling condition of having many sources that are below the detection threshold in a single voxel. On the other hand, because the intensity mapping method does not aim to detect individual galaxies, it will still be able to measure clustering in the large voxel limit with high SNR.  We juxtapose in Figure \ref{fig:snr_vs_time_z1p5} the SNR for the fiducial intensity mapping experiment and galaxy surveys in both the large and small pixel limit in the context of our example for the [CII] power spectrum at $z = 1.48$. As seen in the previous section, a change in aperture does not affect the SNR$_{IM}$ for $k < 0.1$ h/Mpc, but, as expected, dramatically enhances or degrades the capability of galaxy surveys in measuring the power spectrum.  From Figure \ref{fig:snr_vs_time_z1p5} it is clear that the fiducial intensity mapping experiment outperforms galaxy surveys at $z=1.48$ for luminosity functions with faint-end slope $\alpha$ of the tested luminosity functions, and, that this disparity is enhanced in the large pixel limit. In the small pixel limit however, where we expect the galaxy surveys to be capable of measuring the power spectrum with high significance, we see that it becomes important to consider the shape of the luminosity function when drawing conclusions about whether to intensity map or perform a traditional galaxy survey. In fact, it seems that only for the flattest luminosity functions does the small pixel limit improve SNR$_{tot, GS}$ such that it becomes higher than SNR$_{tot,GS}$.

In Figure ~\ref{fig:ngal_frac}, SNR$_{GS}$  is broken down in terms of the number of 5$\sigma$ detections (left panel) and the observed [CII] luminosity density, $\rho_{[CII], obs}$, relative to the total [CII] luminosity density, $\rho_{[CII]}$ (right panel). While SNR$_{GS}$ on the power spectrum may be appreciable, the power spectrum of detected galaxies may not yield a measurement of mean intensity. For instance, as shown in the Figure, while it is possible to reach SNR$_{GS} \sim 10$ with $\sim 100$ galaxies in 200 hours with the fiducial instrument and survey area, the actual fraction of [CII] emission supplied by these detected galaxies is close to 20\%. To recover 50\% or greater of $\rho_{[CII]}$, one must observe for longer than several thousand hours. (For LFs with slopes steeper than $\alpha = -1.0$, the required observing times are significantly longer due to the larger population of faint galaxies.) If, however, one extracts the aggregate, unresolved emission from [CII] via the intensity mapped power spectrum, one is essentially measuring $\frac{\rho_{[CII], obs]}}{\rho_{[CII]}} = 1$ as soon as SNR$_{IM}$ on the linear clustering term of the power spectrum is sufficiently high, which we depict in Figure~\ref{fig:scii_z} for a 5.3 deg$^2$ survey with $t_{obs}^{survey} = 1,000$ hr.


%Another scenario in which an experiment finds itself in the large pixel limit is for observations at long wavelengths. Figure ~\ref{fig:snr_vs_time_z6} shows the envisioned balloon-borne experiment performing a 5.3 deg$^{2}$ survey map of [CII] between $z = 5.4$ and $z = 6.6$, with central frequency now redshifted to 270 GHz (corresponding to $z = 6.0$) and spectral resolution $R=450$. At these frequencies, we use an estimated NEI that is achievable by instruments for use with the future telescope CCAT, namely, $1.1 \times 10^6$ Jy sr$^{-1}$ s$^{1/2}$, which corresponds to line sensitivities for our fiducial aperture of $2.5$m and the CCAT 25.0 m aperture of $1.8\times10^{-18}$ and $1.5\times10^{-20}$ W m$^{-2}$ s$^{1/2}$, respectively. As expected, in the long wavelength limit, the relative performance of the [CII] intensity mapping survey and the traditional galaxy surveys in measuring the galaxy clustering becomes more disparate than at $z=1.5$, in favor of intensity mapping. Again, in the left panel of 
%Figure , which compares intensity mapping and galaxy surveys in the flattest of the three Schechter models considered here, the small pixel limit (here, where $V_{pix}$ is 0.01 times the fiducial value and represents to a CCAT pixel) provides a regime where the galaxy surveys could potentially measure $P_{[CII],[CII]}$ with higher SNR than intensity mapping in a smaller amount of time than it would take intensity mapping experiments to reach the same SNR. But if we look at the fraction of [CII] luminosity density captured by the observed sample (Figure ~\ref{fig:ngal_frac_vs_time_z6}) is $\sim20\%$ and rises above $\sim50\%$ after 3,000 hours of observing time. The intensity mapping experiment in the case of the flattest Schechter function model reaches comparable SNR in 8,000 hours. Thus, it does not seem beneficial to intensity map if the luminosity function is indeed very flat at high redshift. For steeper LFs, however, the intensity mapping experiment becomes the ideal observing technique.

Note that the mean [CII] intensity is increasing for decreasing faint-end slopes, which is a consequence of fixing the total IR light for a given Schechter model to the B11 value, and then applying the $L_{[CII]}-L_{IR}$ relation to predict [CII] luminosity.}

It is important to note that the fractional errors, defined as $f_{err} \equiv \sigma_N /\left(\sqrt{t_{obs}^{pix}} \bar{S}_{\textrm{[CII]}}\right)$, corresponding to the observing times plotted in Figures~\ref{fig:snr_vs_time_z1p5} and \ref{fig:ngal_frac} are in the range of $\sim 300$ to 10, which do not provide insight into the case of low fractional errors achievable by futuristic space telescopes, for example. In this latter regime of high sensitivity observations, we expect the galaxy surveys to be successful in detecting a large number of sources in the full spectrum of faint to bright sources. As a concrete example , we include in the comparison between intensity mapping and galaxy surveys a futuristic experiment aboard a cold space telescope, changing only the achievable NEI in our set of fiducial parameters. For a 6 K telescope with 4\% emissivity, in a single polarization, 25\% instrument transmission, we use in the following analysis an NEI of $4.3\times10^5$ Jy sr$^{-1}$ sec$^{1/2}$ at 393 $\mu$m. (The fractional errors corresponding to such an NEI in the range of observing times from $t_{obs}^{survey} = 100$ to 10$^5$ hr are $f_{err} = 0.1$ to 10.) The top panel of Figure~\ref{fig:spaceNEI} summarizes---for two representative Schechter functions---the relative performance of each observational method in terms of the SNR on the large scale modes of the power spectrum as a function of observing time. The number of [CII]-detections and the fraction of [CII] light recovered by the galaxy survey are shown in the lower two panels, respectively. From this figure, it is clear that such a low-noise galaxy survey experiment supersedes intensity mapping surveys as an effective probe of the majority of the galaxy population in the case of a flat IR luminosity function, which is likely the case at $z = 1.5$. On the other hand, we find that SNR$_{IM}$ is, as in Figure~\ref{fig:snr_vs_time_z1p5}, not degraded, but enhanced in the case of $\alpha = -2.0$.

%\subsection{Implications for $\Makelowercase{z} > 6$}

%As noted in the previous section, Figure~\ref{fig:highz}, as in Figure \ref{fig:}, compares the SNR on large scale modes of the power spectrum for intensity mapping and galaxy surveys, but now at $z = 7$. Since these wavelengths lie outside the range of the fiducial experiment adopted earlier in this paper, we consider at high redshift the capability of the ground-based submm observatory, CSO (d_ap = 10.0 , NEI = ), as well as future ground-based observatory, CCAT ($d_{ap} = 25.0$ m, NEI = ),. 

\section{Discussion}

As noted in Section 4, galaxy surveys performed using instruments with small telescopes and large pixels fare worse in the detection of individual galaxies, and, hence, in measuring the power spectrum compared to intensity mapping experiments using an identical instrument. Another regime where galaxy surveys find themselves in the large-pixel limit is at high-redshift, and so the early studies of [CII] intensity mapping during Reionization are, indeed, well-motivated in this regard. Not to mention, there is also strong evidence for steep ($\alpha \sim -2$) luminosity functions in the rest frame UV at $z\sim7$ \citep{bouwens14}, which additionally positions intensity mapping experiments as better-suited probes of the power spectrum and the aggregate galaxy population than galaxy redshift surveys. Although beyond the scope of this paper, our findings here reinforce the notion that the $z > 6$ Universe presents an ideal opportunity to learn about galaxy populations via intensity mapping

should mention also future NASA FIR surveyor missions (SAFIR?)

\section{Summary}

We have presented predictions for the measurement of the [CII] power spectrum between $0.63 < z < 1.48$, and demonstrated the detectability of the power spectrum in both clustering and shot noise terms in this redshift range. Fluctuations of [CII] intensity have been modeled by combining empirically-constrained estimates of the [CII] luminosity from the B11 IR luminosity function and Spinoglio et al $L_i-L_{IR}$ relations with the theorized dark matter power spectrum. On large scales, the fact that the clustering amplitude of [CII] fluctuations is proportional to the mean [CII] intensity indicates the potential for measuring cosmic evolution of aggregate [CII] emission with the line intensity mapping approach. For the fiducial experiment considered in this paper, we have found that it would be possible to measure the [CII] luminosity density with fractional errors on the order of 10\%. In examining the effect of luminosity function shape, telescope aperture, and fractional error (or instrument noise level) on the relative performances of intensity mapping to galaxy surveys, we have further demonstrated that, in the case where experiments with low fractional errors are not feasible, intensity mapping experiments always outperform galaxy redshift surveys when measuring the mean [CII] intensity, and, for steep luminosity functions, the clustering power spectrum, as well.

\appendix

To explore the effect of the luminosity function shape on the relative performances of intensity mapping and galaxy surveys in observing the [CII] power spectrum and mean intensity of [CII] emitters, we have introduced toy models to represent different $\Phi(L_{IR}, z) \equiv \frac{\textrm{d}N}{\textrm{d}L_{IR}\textrm{d}V}$.

We parametrize our luminosity function as a Schechter function

\begin{equation}
\Phi(L_{IR},z) \textrm{d}L_{IR} = n_* \left(\frac{L_{IR}}{L_*}\right)^{\alpha} \exp\left(-\frac{L_{IR}}{L_*}\right) \textrm{d} \left(\frac{L_{IR}}{L_*}\right)
\end{equation}

where $n_*$ is the normalization for number density, $L_*$ is the characteristic luminosity at the knee, and $\alpha$ is the faint-end slope, as usual. 

Power-law luminosity functions are notoriously ill-behaved if the lower limit of integration for either the luminosity functions or its moments is extended to zero. Rather than implement a break in the power law, we simply cut it off at some $L_{IR, min}$ and choose to fix in our analysis the total IR luminosity density from galaxies as predicted by B11, denoted as $\rho_{IR}^{\textrm{B11}}$, such that

\begin{equation}
\int \textrm{d}\left(\frac{L_{IR}}{L_*}\right) n_* L_* \left(\frac{L_{IR}}{L_*}\right)^{\alpha+1} \exp\left(-\frac{L_{IR}}{L_*}\right) \equiv \rho_{IR}^{\textrm{B11}}
\label{eq:schechterlum}
\end{equation}

This is motivated by the observation that in many cases we do have constraints on the integrated light (from, for example, the cosmic infrared background or from the cosmic star formation rate density or the requirement of critical reionization), whereas we may not in general have detailed constraints on the distribution of light among galaxies, i.e., the shape of luminosity function.
 
The number density of sources, $n$, can, in turn, be computed from 

\begin{equation}
n = \int \textrm{d}\left(\frac{L_{IR}}{L_*}\right) n_* \left(\frac{L_{IR}}{L_*}\right)^{\alpha}\exp\left(-\frac{L_{IR}}{L_*}\right)
\end{equation}

Finally, equation~\ref{eq:schechterlum} allows us to calculate the [CII] luminosity density for each IR-normalized toy model as

\begin{equation}
\rho_{\textrm{[CII]}} = \int \textrm{d}\left(\frac{L_{IR}}{L_*}\right) n_* L_* \left(\frac{L_{IR}}{L_*}\right)^{\alpha} f_{\textrm{[CII]}}L_{IR} \exp\left(-\frac{L_{IR}}{L_*}\right) 
\end{equation}

where $f_{\textrm{[CII]}}$ is the fraction of IR luminosity emitted in [CII], or $\frac{L_{\textrm{[CII]}}(L_{IR})}{L_{IR}}$, described by the Spinoglio relations. Because $L_{\textrm{[CII]}}$ is slightly sublinear in $L_{IR}$, it follows that the toy models with steep faint-end slopes will produce more [CII] emission than their flatter counterparts.
